# About this project
This repository contains the Dockerfile for the `mkpasswd` image. This image is based on the `whois` package and allows you to generate secure passwords using the `mkpasswd` command.

# Available Docker Images
Use the `latest` tag to get the latest stable release of the image.

<a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/serversideup/mkpasswd/tags"><img alt="Docker Image Size" src="https://img.shields.io/docker/image-size/serversideup/mkpasswd"></a>

## Usage

This Docker container allows you to generate passwords using `mkpasswd` from the `whois` package with customizable options.

### Running the Container

You can run this Docker container directly using the command line. By default, it uses SHA-512 as the hashing method.

```bash
docker run --rm serversideup/mkpasswd
```

This command will output a salted hash which you can use directly.

### Customizing Password Generation

#### Specifying a Method

To specify a different hashing method, you can provide the `--method` option followed by the method name. Supported methods include `sha-512`, `md5`, among others.

```bash
docker run --rm serversideup/mkpasswd --method=md5
```

This will generate a hash using the MD5 method.

#### Adding Salt

To add a specific salt, use the `-S` option followed by your desired salt value.

```bash
docker run --rm serversideup/mkpasswd --method=sha-512 -S mysalt
```

This command uses SHA-512 with a custom salt, enhancing the security of the generated hash.

### Defaults

The default behavior without any additional arguments is to generate a salted hash using the SHA-512 method. If no specific salt is provided, `mkpasswd` automatically generates a random salt.

### Examples

Here are some examples of how to use this Docker image:

- **Generate a default SHA-512 salted hash**:
  ```bash
  docker run --rm serversideup/mkpasswd
  ```

- **Generate a hash using MD5 without a salt**:
  ```bash
  docker run --rm serversideup/mkpasswd --method=md5
  ```

- **Generate a hash using SHA-512 with a specified salt**:
  ```bash
  docker run --rm serversideup/mkpasswd --method=sha-512 -S mysalt
  ```

These examples should help you get started with generating passwords securely using the Docker container.
